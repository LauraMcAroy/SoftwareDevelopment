# SoftwareDevelopment


Sitting down with the user and creating a list of their needs in the form of a "to-do" list gives the team a broad overview of what functions the project needs to have and serves as a starting point. The user stories provide the functional requirements of each of the user's needs from the perspective of an end user, so a better assessment can be made of what all needs to be done to complete each task.

After getting all of the requirements from the user, the first step in developing a program is deciding which method to use, i.e. waterfall or agile. Products that are predictable and are unlikely to change in requirements would benefit from a waterfall method, while others might benefit greatly from an agile approach. Going forward in my future work, I would like to break the work down into segments, like a sprint, to be completed piece by piece until the entire project is done. I would also hope to be highly adaptable to changes.

Being a good team member requires pulling your own weight, providing timely results and acting as a resource to other team members when needed. Being able to communicate effectively and collaborate with others are also crucial when working with others.
